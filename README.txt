In this repository, There are 36 directories that in each of them,
some concepts of javascript are implemented.These directories are numbered
from 1 to 36.

In directories number 35 and 36, two projects are implemented.

In these projects a page designed to get input from client and
show all the inputs(inputs are called tasks in these projects).
client can search to find his/her tasks.
  
The only difference between the projects is that in the secend project,
localStorage is used to save the tasks.
